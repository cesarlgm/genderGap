\section{Data notes}
\subsection{Residualization procedure}
Throughout this document I explore the relationship between average wages (gender wage gap) and CZ population density. I am also interested in how this relationship has changed over time.

To discard the possibility that the observed relationships arise because of simple changes in the population composition, I compute average wages net of individuals' characteristics.

\paragraph{Procedure}
\benu
	\item I regress log of the individuals' wages on individual characteristics separately by year, including a gender $\times$ CZ fixed effect. Models are estimated separately for each census year.
	\beqns
		w_{igrt}=X_{irt}\gamma_t+\lambda_{rt}^g
	\eeqns
	\item $\hat{\lambda}_{grt}$ is my estimate of CZ wages, net of individual characteristics.
	\item I compute the CZ-specific gender gap as:
	\beqns
		gap_{rt}=\hat{\lambda}_{rt}^m-\hat{\lambda}_{rt}^f
	\eeqns

Throughout the document, the control variables $X_{irt}$ come into for different sets:
\bitem
	\item \textbf{Basic controls:} age dummies, race dummies, and foreign born dummy.
	\item \textbf{Human capital:} basic controls + 4-level education dummies.
	\item \textbf{Industry controls:} human capital controls + $\approx$ 150 industry fixed effects.
	\item \textbf{Full controls:} industry controls + occupation fixed effects.
