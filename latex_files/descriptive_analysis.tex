\section{Descriptive analysis}
\subsection{Basic facts and trends}
\bitem
\item Most CZ are relative small. 40\% of CZ account for 85\% of the of the total population in almost all years.
\item CZ at the very top have lost population share. "Mid"-tier cities are the ones with the fastest population growth.
\item Overall, the US has experienced manufacturing decline. But decline has been much faster in the top 30\% CZ (see \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/cp9v7uk87lyij4r/bar_deciles_manufacturing.png?dl=0}{here}).

\subsection{The gender gap}
\bitem
\item Wage gap is decreasing everywhere. But decline is faster in densest CZ.
\item There is a clear inversion of the gender-gap density gradient. 
\item This inversion is also present if I focus attention to the top 248 CZ.

\subsection{LFP}
\bitem
	\item Employment to population ratio has always had an U pattern for men. The U pattern has exacerbated over the years. Decline in middle places has been faster. This is in line with the Ely Lecture (see \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/w0m6oerp6mt7edg/bar_graph_lfp_male.png?dl=0}{here})
	\item For women, densest places offered more employment at the start. Over time, they have become more like men. U pattern seems to be intriguing  (see \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/mhlqjp6k73i9ub4/bar_graph_lfp_women.png?dl=0}{here})
	\item What about the absolute values:
	\bitem
		\item For men, the story if one of decline in LFP. With faster decline in the middle of the distribution. See \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/rdhcj6im9xt1ad3/bar_graph_d_lfp_male.png?dl=0}{here}
		\item For women, the story is one of faster progress at the tails of the distribution. \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/sl9vlat28ongdlb/bar_graph_d_lfp_female.png?dl=0}{here}
