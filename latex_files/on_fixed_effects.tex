\section{When would the national level fixed-effects account for the cross-sectional variation?}

Suppose the wage profile of individuals is determined as follows:
\beqn
	w_{ir}=\lambda_e
\eeqn
where $\lambda_e$ is a national-level fixed effects. Then,
\beqn
\bar{w}_{r}^g=\sum_e\lambda_es_{r}^g
\eeqn
then the gender gap in a given commuting zone is given by,
\beqn
\bar{w}_{r}^m-\bar{w}_{r}^f=\sum_e^g\lambda_e^g(s_{r}^m-s_{r}^f)
\eeqn
suppose that:
\beqn
s_{r}^g=\alpha_e^g+\beta_e^g\log(density)_r
\eeqn
then gender gap equation becomes,
\beqn
\bar{w}_{r}^m-\bar{w}_{r}^f=\sum_e\lambda_e(\alpha_e^m-\alpha_e^f)+\sum_e\lambda_e(\beta_e^m-\beta_e^f)\log(density)_r
\eeqn
It follows that $\sum_e\beta_e^g=1$. This follows from the identity below holding for all CZ:
\beqn
	1=\sum_es_{er}^g=\sum_e\alpha_e^g+(\sum_e\beta_e^g)\log(density)_r
\eeqn
So a negative coefficient in density requires:
\beqn
\sum_e\lambda_e(\beta_e^m-\beta_e^f)<0
\eeqn
Which roughly requires that have a higher gradient on density in employment in ``high-pay'' groups relative to men.

Now suppose that the wage profile is given by: 
\beqn
w_{ir}=\lambda_e^g
\eeqn
then,
\beqn
\bar{w}_{r}^m-\bar{w}_{r}^f&=&\sum_e\lambda_e^ms_{er}^m-\lambda_e^fs_{er}^f\\
&=&\sum_e(\lambda_e^m-\lambda_e^f)s_{er}^m+\lambda_e^f(s_{er}^m-s_{er}^f)
\eeqn
thus it would have to be that the employment structure of the densest CZ is concentrated in those groups that experience the largest gender gap decline at the national level.
