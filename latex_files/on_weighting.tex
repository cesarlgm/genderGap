\section{On weighting}

Here the basic question I want to answer is, can I have a good answer as to why I am not weighting. 

Suppose wages are determined according to the model:
\beqn
	w_{ir}^g=\beta X_{ir}^g+\varepsilon_{ir}^g
\eeqn
where $\varepsilon_{ir}^g=\gamma_r^g+u_{ir}$ where $\gamma_r^g$ and $u_{ir}$ are independent. 
\beqns
	\label{eqns:unweighted}
	\bar{w}_r^m-\bar{w}_r^f&=&\beta (X_{r}^m-X_{r}^f)+\bar{\varepsilon}_r^m-\bar{\varepsilon}_r^f\\
	&=&\beta (X_{r}^m- X_{r}^f)+v_r
\eeqns
note that if we assume that $var(\gamma_r^g)=\sigma_\gamma^2$ and $var(u_{ir})=\sigma_u^2$.
\beqns
	var(v_r)&=var(\bar{\varepsilon}_r^m)+var(\bar{\varepsilon}_r^f)-cov(\bar{\varepsilon}_r^m,\bar{\varepsilon}_r^f)\\
	&=2\sigma_\gamma^2+\sigma_u^2\left(\frac{1}{N_m}+\frac{1}{N_f}\right)
\eeqns
so, in the end I can test whether heteroskedasticity is a problem by running the regression (\ref{eqns:unweighted}) by OLS, extract the residuals and then run the regression:
\beqns
	\hat{u}_r=\alpha+\beta\left(\frac{1}{N_m}+\frac{1}{N_f}\right)
\eeqns

The results from this exercise give little justification for weighting the regressions. See this \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4lwvmlh403kcyv/heteroskedasticity_test.txt?dl=0}{log-file}.
