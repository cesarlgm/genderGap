\section{Robustness of facts 3 and 4}
\subsection{Composition of the sample}
\bitem
\item Results are robust to including all male and female workers.
\item Results are also results for controlling for basic demographics
\eitem
\subsection{Weighting of regressions}
Both facts are robust to alternative weighting mechanisms. Weighting only changes the timing of the decline in the population density gradient. 
\bitem
	\item This happens because decline of the gap happens first in denser places and then it decelerates. 
	\item Places at medium levels of density speed the decline from 1990 on. This would explain the difference between between weighted and unweighted estimates.
\eitem	

\subsection{Alternative measures of density}
\bitem
\item Results are robust to using population as a measure of density.
