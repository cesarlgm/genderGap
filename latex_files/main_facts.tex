\section{Basic findings}
\subsection{Densest CZ have experienced a largest decline in the gender wage gap}
Consider the regression
\beqns
	gap_{r2020}-gap_{r1970}=\alpha + \beta\ln(density)_{r1970}
\eeqns
where $gap_r=w_r^{male}-w_r^{female}$, where $w$ stands for average log-wage in the commuting zone.


Table \ref{table:overall_change} shows the estimates of $\beta$ for different average wage measures. All the estimates are significant and negative $\implies$ densest CZ experienced a significantly larger reductions in the gender wage gap. 

\paragraph{Several observations}
\bitem 
	\item \textbf{Density measure:} \cite{Duranton2020} argue that total population is more linked to the ``experienced'' density in a labor market, than the ``naive'' measure of population density. Table \ref{table:overall_change} shows that the gradient is virtually unchanged when using: ``naive'' CZ population density, or total CZ population.
	\item \textbf{Magnitude of the coefficient:} The gradient is large under multiple benchmarks. Let's focus on interpreting the gradient for the raw wage gap on population density.
	\bitem 
		\item \textbf{Standardized effect} an increase of 1 s.d. in population density (1.18) $\implies$ a change of -.4 s.d.  in the gender wage gap.  A model with just just population density accounts for 17\% of the variation 1970-2020 gender gap change.
		\item \textbf{IC gap:} a CZ in the 25 percentile had an expected decline in the gap of 23 log points. In contrast, a CZ in the 75 percentile experienced a 27 log-point decline $\implies$ a decrease that is 17\% larger.  
		\item \textbf{IC gap relative to the mean:} the 4 log-point gap is equivalent to $15.6\%$ of the decline in the gender gap for \textit{the average CZ}.

\subsection{The relationship between density and gender gap went from positive to negative during 1970-2020}

In figure \ref{figure:baseline_gradients} I show estimates of $\beta_t$ in the regression:
\beqns
	gap_{rt}=\alpha_t+\beta_t\ln(density)_{rt}
\eeqns

\paragraph{Several remarks}
\bitem
	\item The density gradient declined gradually over the period. It went from positive in 1970 to negative in the 2020.
	\item The gradient declines roughly in 2.7 log-points, which roughly corresponds to the coefficient found in in the previous section.
	\item The inversion of the gradient is robust to controlling for basic individual characteristics.
\eitem 
\input{../2_analysis/output/figures/baseline_gradients.tex}

\paragraph{The cross-sectional gradient in perspective:}
\bitem 
\item \textbf{Implied IC gap}:
\bitem
	\item 1970: 2.8 log-points $\implies$ .4 s.d. increase in gender gap. This is also equivalent to an increase of 7\% in the gender wage gap. 
	\item 2020: 1.16 log-points $\implies$ .3 s.d. increase in gender gap. This is also equivalent to an increase of 6\% in the gender gap. If I account for differences in the age distribution of the population, then this difference becomes 2 log-points. Again, this is roughly equivalent to .2 s.d. in the adjusted wage gap.
\eitem
	\item \textbf{In international perspective:} 
	\bitem 
	\item The US is the 6th country with the highest gender gap within the the OECD. Moving from a 10th percentile CZ to a 90th in 2020 $\implies$ decline of 3 log-points in the gender gap. This is roughly equivalent to moving from the US to Germany $\approx$ erasing 50\% of the gap between the US and the average for OECD countries \href{https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/gender-wage-gap.htm}{see this data}.
	\item \textbf{Tangential remark on gender sd:} there is as much variation in the gender gap within the US (2020), as there is in the across countries in the OECD.

\eitem
\item \textbf{In terms of the urban wage premium?}
\bitem 
	\item \textbf{In 2020}: the urban wage premium for men was of 4.4 log points. For women was 5.2 log-points $\implies$ 18\% larger premium for women. Adjusting wages for age / race $\implies$ premium for women was 25\% larger than for men.
	\item \textbf{Change across time:} since the peak in 1990, male's premium declined by 3.84 log-points 47\% (41\% when adjusting by age / race). By comparison, women's premium declined by 2.25 log points. This a decline of 30\% (26\% when adjusted by age / race) $\implies$ this is a big difference in the evolution of men's and women's fortunes. Women's decline in the premium is just 58\% of men's decline in the premium.
\eitem
My conclusion here, is that the observed coefficients on density are big relative to the overall within-country variation in the gender gap, even though the IC seems modest.
\eitem

\subsection{Further checks}
\subsubsection{Is the density gradient just capturing cross-region variation?} No. The gradient and it drift is robust to controlling for region and state fixed effects!

\input{../2_analysis/output/figures/region_fe_full_time.tex}


\subsubsection{The drift in the gradient is not driven just by small / rural CZ}

One concern with the results in the previous sections is that they might be driven by very small CZ, which are relatively unpopulated and which have little bearing in the overall US labor market. To study whether this is a concern I also compute gradients for ``big'' CZ.  I define big CZ as those which had a population density of at least 2.5 people per km$^2$ in 1950. These 175 CZs had a median population of 316k people and accounted for around 74\% of the US population in all the years I am considering. 



Figure \ref{fig:big_CZ} shows that this is not the case. There I compare the gradients for all CZ vs those I get when I limit estimation to big CZ only. Two features stand out:
\benu
	\item The gradient \textit{also arises for the} the largest CZ.
	\item Big CZ also feature a decline in the gender-gap gradient. However, this decline is concentrated on the 1970-1990 period. From then on, the gradient remains negative and roughly constant. Panel (b) shows that the picture remains unchanged if I adjust wages for age / race.
\eenu

\begin{block}{Takeway from this exercise:}
	The gender gap gradient is not driven just by small CZ. Big CZ feature a more striking pattern of gradient decline during 1970-1990. Smaller CZ do drive the gradual decline from 1990 onward.
\end{block}

\section{Questions inspired by these facts?}
\bitem
	\item Why has the decline in the urban premium has been less severe for women over the period?
	\item What explains the inversion in the gender gap - density gradient?
	\item Do women benefit more from moving to a city today?
\eitem


\subsection{Incipient answers}
\subsubsection{Do women benefit more from cities?}
\paragraph{Fixing ideas}
To fix ideas let's consider the following model for wages, where $g$ indexes gender and $r$ indexes region:
\beqns
	w_{iert}^g=\alpha_t+\delta_{et}+\gamma_{ert}^g+\varepsilon_{it}
\eeqns
For the sake of the argument, suppose $e$ indexes education. Here $\delta_e$ represents the economy-wide return to having education $e$, while $\gamma$ represents the region-specific return to education. Then, the average wage in a commuting zone is given by,
\beqns
		w_{rt}^g=\alpha_t+\sum_es_{ert}^g\delta_{et}+\sum_es_{ert}\gamma_{ert}+u_{rt}
\eeqns
To fix ideas, let us impose the strong assumption that $\gamma_{ert}=\omega^g_t\ln(density)_{rt}$ the above equation reduces to:
\beqns
	w_{rt}^g=\alpha_t+\sum_es_{ert}^g\delta_e+\omega^g\ln(density)_{rt}+u_{rt}
\eeqns
By running the regression:
\beqns
	w_{rt}^g=\alpha+\beta^g_t\ln(density)_{rt}
\eeqns
we have that:
\beqns
	plim(\beta^g_t)=\omega^g_t+\frac{cov(\sum_es_{ert}^g\delta_{et},\ln(density)_{rt})}{var(\ln(density)_{rt})}
\eeqns
therefore $\beta^g_t$ has two components
\bitem
	\item $\omega^g_t=$ gender-specific urban wage premium.
	\item A term reflecting bias due to heterogeneous composition of the population across labor markets. For example, if high-wage groups are more likely to locate in cites $\implies$ $\beta^g_t$ overestimates the gains from moving to a city.
\eitem
I will impose another strong assumption. Let $\frac{cov(\sum_es_{er}\delta_e,\ln(density))}{var(\ln(density)_r)}=\chi^g$.

Then, abusing a bit of notation, we have
\beqns
	\beta^g_t=\omega^g_t+\chi^g_t
\eeqns
This simple model suggests a procedure to decompose the density gradient into the selection / urban premium components.
\benu
	\item $\beta_t^g$ is obtained from a simple regression of average \textit{raw wages} on population density.
	\item Under the assumption of $\gamma_{er}=\omega^g\ln(density)_r$ an individual's wage is reduced to:
	\beqns
		w^g_{iert}=\alpha_t+\delta_{et}+\gamma_{rt}^g+\varepsilon_i
	\eeqns
	which is just a regression of individual's wages on education fixed-effects, and a gender$\times$CZ fixed effects. In this case $\gamma_{rt	}^g$ gives an estimate of $\omega^g_t\ln(density)_{rt}$.
	\item From there, it is straight forward to obtain an estimate of the urban wage premium, just estimate the regression:
	\beqns
		\gamma^g_{rt}=\eta_t + \omega_t^g ln(density)_{rt}
	\eeqns 
	\item The selection component is obtained out of the difference between the estimates in part 1 and 3.
\eenu
\subparagraph{Some remarks:}
\bitem 
	\item In the discussion above I am assuming that the urban wage premium is the same for education groups $\gamma_{er}^g=\omega^g\ln(density)_{rt}$. If the premium were education-specific then,
	\beqns
		w_{rt}^g=\alpha_t+\sum_es_{ert}^g\delta_{et}+\sum_es_{ert}\omega^g_{et}\ln(density)_{ert}+u_{rt}
	\eeqns
	which would introduce heterogeneity of density gradient across commuting zones. One can easily explore whether this is an issue by estimating $\omega^g$ by education group (this is feasible only when there is a limited number of education groups).
\eitem 

\paragraph{Results}
\subparagraph{Premium today:} in the table below I show the decomposition described above under different sets of controls.\newline
\textbf{Interpretation notes:}
\bitem
	\item From left to right, each column adds a new set of regressors controls. Thus the interpretation of the selection component in, say the human capital column, is how much of the density gradient is accounted by the human capital controls, over an above the basic set of controls. As a result, the $\%$ explained column is computed relative to the adjusted premium in the basic column.
	\item A negative selection component $\implies$ denser cities have higher shares of low wage groups.
	\item A positive component $\implies$ denser cities have higher shares of low income groups.
\eitem
\textbf{What does stand out?}
\bitem
	\item Women's premium is always larger than men's.
	\item Selection component of basic (age, rage, foreign born dummies) is always negative (city's population is blacker and younger, which tend to be associated with a lower income). \textit{Selection on basic demographics} is twice as important for women than for men.
	\item Selection on education, industry, occupation is very similar for both genders.
	\item \textbf{Overall message:} even after accounting for this rich set of characteristics, women's premium is positive and bigger than men. Cities appear to draw more women from low-wage groups $\implies$ accounting for different demographic composition actually \textit{increases} women's relative density premium.
\eitem
\subparagraph{Premium over time}
The table below shows the decomposition of the density gradient for three selected years. \newline
\textbf{What does stand out?}
\bitem 
	\item In 1970, city women were more likely to come from low education groups. This had reversed by 2020.
	\item 1970-1990: Accounting for industry of employment eliminates the gender gap in the urban premium. Even though both genders are employed in higher pay industries in cities, men are more likely to do so $\implies$ most of density premium can be explained by gender segregation across industries.
	\item Note however, that industry and occupation do not erase the gap in the urban premium across genders in 2020. Even after accounting for industry and employment, the women's premium is 56\% larger than men's.
	\item The table also makes clear the pattern already noted by [cite autor here]. There's a precipitous decline in men's urban wage premium. If we concentrated in the last column, between 1990 and 2020 men's premium declines by 61\%. What is remarkable, is that women's premium is relatively more resilient, declining by 40\% over the same period.
	\item Without adjusting for industry and occupation men's decline in the premium was so strong that it went from being \textit{above} women's, to being below it.
\eitem 

The attached coefficient plots basically paint the same picture. They also suggests that the reversal of fortunes happened during the 1990s. From then on, there is a gradual expansion of the gender gap in the premium.

\paragraph{Some interpretation caveats}
\bitem
	\item In the discussion above I am interpreting  $\hat{\omega}^m_t-\hat{\omega}^f_t$ as evidence of differneces genders in the urban wage premium. This interpretation might not be correct. For example, suppose that urban wage premium differs by education level, but not across genders. That is:
	\beqns
		\gamma_{ert}^m=\gamma_{ert}^f=\omega_{et}\ln(density)_{er}
	\eeqns
	note that in this case:
	\beqns
		w_{rt}^m-w_{rt}^f=\alpha^m_t-\alpha^f_t+\sum_e\delta_e(s_{ert}^m-s_{ert}^f)+\sum_{e}\omega_{et}(s_{ert}^m-s_{ert}^f)\ln(density)_{rt}+u_{rt}
	\eeqns
	Under this scenario the gradient on density is given by:
	\beqns
		\sum_{e}\omega_{et}(s_{ert}^m-s_{ert}^f)
	\eeqns
	The expression above will likely be negative if:
	\bitem 
		\item Women concentrate more heavily in high urban wage premium groups.
	\eitem 
	If we now focus on the drift down of the premium, men's advantage will decline if:
	\bitem
		\item The premium for men-heavy groups is declining over time.
		\item Or women are increasingly concentrating in high urban premium groups.
	\eitem
	Note that this model also suggests' a quick way to discard this possibility. Note that the within-group gender wage wage is given by:
	\beqns
			w_{ert}^m-w_{ert}^f=\alpha^m_t-\alpha^f_t+u_{rt}
	\eeqns
	thus there shouldn't be a within-group gender-gap gradient on density. Given the increase in women's educational attainment since the 1970 education is a natural target to apply this test.
	
	The discussion above takes the proposed model too seriously, but it gives an useful intuition. If the drift in the gender-gap premium is driven by differences in group premia + changes in the the composition of the labor force across genders, then these issues should be less prevalent when I compute the regressions by group.
\eitem 

\addfig{.75}{../2_analysis/output/tables/decomposition_1990_2020}

\subsection{Are the results above driven different wage premium across educational groups?}

\noindent\textbf{Short answer}: no. But the drift in the gender-gap gradient is driven by workers without a bachelor degree.

Panel a in figure \ref{figure:education_shares} shows that women educational attainment have increased dramatically relative to men. Panel b shows that it has increased more in the densest labor markets. If the urban wage premium of college graduates is larger than non-college graduates, then this trends could drive the patterns described in previous sections.


\input{../2_analysis/output/figures/education_share_gradients}


In panel a of figure \ref{figure:education}, I show estimates of $\beta_{et}$ for the following regression model:
\beqns
w^m_{rt}-w^f_{rt}=\alpha_{et}+\beta_{et}\ln(density)_{rt}
\eeqns
If all the variation is driven by changes in education-specific urban wage premium, then we should expect $\beta_{et}$ to be zero in all years. This is not what the data shows. The gender-gap gradient is positive and mostly constant for college graduates. The decline in the gradient arises for non-college graduates only. Panel b shows that adjusting the gap for age and race does not change this finding (panel b).


Panels c and d show the density premiums by gender. There I plot the density slope in regressions of the form:
\beqns 
	w^g_{rt}=\alpha_{et}^g+\beta_{et}^g\ln(density)_{rt}
\eeqns

\bitem
	\item Women with a bachelor degree benefit \textit{less} from cities than men. Moreover, panel (b) shows that there is no decline in the urban wage premium for college workers. This is consistent with the findings by [autor].
	\item The decline for non college workers happens in both genders. But again, women are less affected by this development $\implies$ \textit{the reversal of fortunes is happening for college without a college education.}
\eitem 

Although education is an endogenous outcome, it is remarkable that the urban wage premium for college graduates is so constant for both genders over the whole period. 
\bitem
	\item Women's labor force participation and educational attainment has increased massively over the years. Moreover, their concentration in urban areas has also increased. If anything, a simple supply-demand framework would have suggested that the gender-gap premium should have decreased.
	\item This begs the question of whether the urban wage premium is smaller for college women. If so, what prevents them from reaping the same benefits as men from cities?
\eitem

\subsection{1970-1990: a tale of women's accession to high pay industries}

Figure \ref{fig:controls} suggests that industry of employment accounts for both the (i) cross-sectional gender-gap gradient, and (ii) its decline during 1990-2020. Here I zoom in on the relationship between industrial structure, population density, and employment shares across genders.

\subsubsection{Which are the high-pay industries?}
